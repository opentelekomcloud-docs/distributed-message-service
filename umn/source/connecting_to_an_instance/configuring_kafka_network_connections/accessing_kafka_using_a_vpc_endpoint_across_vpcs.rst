Accessing Kafka Using a VPC Endpoint Across VPCs
================================================

Context
-------

VPCs are logically isolated from each other. If a Kafka instance and a Kafka client are in different VPCs within a region, they cannot communicate with each other. In this case, you can use one of the following methods to access a Kafka instance across VPCs:

-  Establish a VPC peering connection to allow two VPCs to communicate with each other. For details, see `VPC Peering Connection <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/vpc/vpc_peering_0000.html>`__.
-  Use VPC Endpoint (VPCEP) to establish a cross-VPC connection.

Scenario
--------

The following describes how to use VPCEP to implement cross-VPC access.

VPCEP provides two types of resources: VPC endpoint services and VPC endpoints.

-  A VPC endpoint service can be a Kafka instance which is accessed using VPC endpoints.
-  A VPC endpoint is a secure and private channel for connecting a VPC to a VPC endpoint service.

#. .. _kafka-ug-0001__li11323122315289:

   Call the VPC Endpoint API to create a VPC endpoint service. For details, see `Creating a VPC Endpoint Service <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/api/vpcep/vpcep_06_0201.html>`__.

   .. code-block:: text

      POST https://{endpoint}/v1/{project_id}/vpc-endpoint-services

   Set the following request parameter to the specified values, and other parameters as required.

   -  **port_id**: one of the port IDs obtained in :ref:`5 <kafka-ug-0001__li1470016488194>`.
   -  **vpc_id**: VPC ID obtained in :ref:`7 <kafka-ug-0001__li19701310122315>`.
   -  **server_type**: **VM**
   -  **client_port**: **9011**
   -  **server_port**: **9011**
   -  **protocol**: **TCP**
   -  **approval_enabled**: **false**
   -  **service_type**: **interface**
   -  **endpoint**: VPCEP endpoint obtained from `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/endpoint/index.html>`__. The region must be the same as that of the Kafka instance.
   -  **project_id**: project ID obtained from `Obtaining a Project ID <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/api/vpcep/vpcep_08_0003.html>`__. The region must be the same as that of the Kafka instance.

   Record the value of **service_name** in the response. This parameter indicates the name of the VPC endpoint service.

#. .. _kafka-ug-0001__li7368125918119:

   Repeat :ref:`8 <kafka-ug-0001__li11323122315289>` to create VPC endpoint services for other port IDs obtained in :ref:`5 <kafka-ug-0001__li1470016488194>` and record the VPC endpoint service names.

(Optional) Adding a Whitelist Record
------------------------------------

If the Kafka client and Kafka instance belong to different accounts, add the ID of the account to which the Kafka client belongs to the whitelist of the endpoint service. For details, see `Add a Whitelist Record <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/vpcep/vpcep_02_02034.html>`__.

Creating a VPC Endpoint
-----------------------

#. .. _kafka-ug-0001__li182701720183719:

   Click **Service List**. Then choose **Network** > **VPC Endpoint**.

#. Click **Create VPC Endpoint**.

#. Set the following parameters:

   -  **Region**: Select the region that the Kafka instance is in.
   -  **Service Category**: Select **Find a service by name**.
   -  **VPC Endpoint Service Name**: Enter the VPC endpoint service name recorded in :ref:`8 <kafka-ug-0001__li11323122315289>` and click **Verify**. If **Service name found** is displayed, proceed with subsequent operations.
   -  **VPC**: Select the VPC that the Kafka client is in.
   -  **Subnet**: Select the subnet that the Kafka client is in.
   -  **Private IP Address**: Select **Automatic**.

   Retain the default values for other parameters. For details, see `Creating a VPC Endpoint <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/usermanual/vpcep/en-us_topic_0131645189.html>`__.

#. Click **Create Now**.

#. Confirm the configurations and submit the request.

#. Go back to the VPC endpoint list and check whether the status of the created VPC endpoint has changed to **Accepted**. The **Accepted** state means that the VPC endpoint has been connected to the VPC endpoint service.

Changing the advertised.listeners IP Addresses
----------------------------------------------

#. Click **Service List** and choose **Application** > **Distributed Message Service**. The Kafka instance list is displayed.

#. Click the desired Kafka instance to view its details.

#. On the **Advanced Settings** section of the **Basic Information** tab page, click **Modify** for **Cross-VPC Access** to change the value of **advertised.listeners IP address** to the private IP addresses recorded in :ref:`7 <kafka-ug-0001__li1942253845112>` and :ref:`8 <kafka-ug-0001__li923645116109>`. Click **Save**.

   .. important::

      Each IP address must match the corresponding port ID. Otherwise, the network will be disconnected.

Verifying Connectivity
----------------------

Check whether messages can be created and retrieved by referring to :ref:`Connecting to Kafka Using the Client (Plaintext Access) <kafka-ug-180604020>` or :ref:`Connecting to Kafka Using the Client (Ciphertext Access) <kafka-ug-180801001>`.

Notes:

-  The address for connecting to a Kafka instance is in the format of "*advertised.listeners IP*\ **:9011**". For example, the addresses for connecting to the Kafka instance shown in :ref:`Figure 8 <kafka-ug-0001__fig6446112151915>` are **10.158.0.151:9011,10.158.0.162:9011,10.158.0.164:9011**.
-  Configure inbound rules for the security group of the Kafka instance to allow access from **198.19.128.0/17** over port **9011**.
-  If a network access control list (ACL) has been configured for the subnet of this instance, configure inbound rules for the network ACL to allow access from **198.19.128.0/17** and from the subnet used by the VPC endpoint.

.. note::

   **198.19.128.0/17** is the network segment allocated to the VPCEP service. To use VPCEP, allow access from this network segment.
