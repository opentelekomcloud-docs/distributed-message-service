What Can I Do When I Fail to Increase Specifications Due to Insufficient Resources?
===================================================================================

**Symptom**: Specifications fail to be increased, and a message is displayed indicating that the underlying ECS/EVS resources are insufficient. However, the required ECSs can be purchased on the ECS console.

**Possible cause**: The underlying resource quota is different from the available flavor quota displayed on the console.

**Solution**: Contact customer service to increase the quota.
