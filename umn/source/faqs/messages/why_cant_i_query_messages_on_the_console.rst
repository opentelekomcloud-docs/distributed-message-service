Why Can't I Query Messages on the Console?
==========================================

-  **Possible cause 1**: The message has been aged.

   **Solution**: :ref:`Change the aging time <kafka-ug-200506001>`.

-  **Possible cause 2**: The createTime timestamp of the message is incorrect.

   On the console, messages are queried based on the timestamp, which is generated by the client. Different clients have different processing policies. The default value may be **0** or **-1**. As a result, message may fail to be queried.

   **Solution**: Check whether the value of createTime is correctly configured.

-  **Possible cause 3**: The disk usage exceeds 95%, and **Capacity Threshold Policy** is set to **Automatically delete**.

   If **Capacity Threshold Policy** is set to **Automatically delete**, the earliest 10% of messages will be deleted when 95% of the disk capacity is used, to ensure sufficient disk space. In this case, the messages that do not reach the aging time are also deleted and cannot be queried.

   **Solution**: :ref:`Modify the capacity threshold policy <kafka-ug-180604014>` or :ref:`expand the disk capacity <kafka-ug-181221001>`. If **Capacity Threshold Policy** is set to **Stop production**, new messages will no longer be created when the disk usage reaches the disk capacity threshold (95%), but existing messages can still be retrieved until the aging time arrives. This policy is suitable for scenarios where no data losses can be tolerated.
