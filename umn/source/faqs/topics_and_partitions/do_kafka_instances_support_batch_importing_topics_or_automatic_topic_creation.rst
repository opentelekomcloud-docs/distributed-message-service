Do Kafka Instances Support Batch Importing Topics or Automatic Topic Creation?
==============================================================================

Automatic topic creation is supported, but batch topic import is not supported. You can only export topics in batches.

Enable automatic topic creation using one of the following methods:

-  :ref:`When creating an instance, enable automatic topic creation <kafka-ug-180604013>`.
-  After an instance is created, :ref:`enable automatic topic creation on the Basic Information tab page <kafka_ug_0043>`.
