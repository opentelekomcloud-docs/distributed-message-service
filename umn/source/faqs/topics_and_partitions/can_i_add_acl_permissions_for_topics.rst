Can I Add ACL Permissions for Topics?
=====================================

If you have enabled SASL_SSL for your Kafka instance, you can configure ACL permissions for your topics. On the **Topics** tab page of the Kafka console, click **Grant User Permission** in the row that contains the topic for which you want to configure user permissions.

For details, see :ref:`Granting Permissions to a SASL_SSL User <kafka-ug-0002>`.
