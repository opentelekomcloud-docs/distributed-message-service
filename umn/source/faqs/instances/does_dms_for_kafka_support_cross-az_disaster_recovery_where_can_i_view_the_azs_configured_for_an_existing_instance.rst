Does DMS for Kafka Support Cross-AZ Disaster Recovery? Where Can I View the AZs Configured for an Existing Instance?
====================================================================================================================

DMS for Kafka supports cross-AZ disaster recovery. If you select multiple AZs when creating an instance, cross-AZ disaster recovery will be available.

You can view the AZs configured for an instance in the **Network** section on the **Basic Information** tab page of the instance. If there are multiple AZs, cross-AZ disaster recovery is available.
