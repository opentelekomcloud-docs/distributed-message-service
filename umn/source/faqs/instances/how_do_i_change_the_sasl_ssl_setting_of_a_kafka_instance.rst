How Do I Change the SASL_SSL Setting of a Kafka Instance?
=========================================================

-  The SASL_SSL setting can be changed for cluster instances. For details, see :ref:`Configuring Plaintext or Ciphertext Access to Kafka Instances <kafka_ug_0044>`.
-  A single-node instance does not support SASL_SSL.
-  SASL_SSL cannot be modified for instances with IPv6 enabled.
