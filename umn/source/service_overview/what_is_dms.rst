What Is DMS?
============

Apache Kafka is distributed message middleware that features high throughput, data persistence, horizontal scalability, and stream data processing. It adopts the publish-subscribe pattern and is widely used for log collection, data streaming, online/offline system analytics, and real-time monitoring.

DMS is a message queuing service based on Apache Kafka. It provides Kafka instances with isolated compute, storage, and bandwidth resources. DMS allows you to apply and configure resources based on service requirements. It can be used out of the box and frees you from deployment and O&M so that you can focus on the agile development of your applications.
