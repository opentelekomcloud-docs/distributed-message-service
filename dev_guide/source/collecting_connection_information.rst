Collecting Connection Information
=================================

Required Kafka Instance Information
-----------------------------------

-  Instance connection address and port

   After an instance is created, you can obtain the IP address from the **Basic Information** tab page of the instance. You can configure all IP addresses on the client. For example, as shown in the following figure, a 100 MB/s instance has three addresses. Instances of other specifications may have a different number of brokers, so the number of addresses vary.

   For public network access, you can use the public network addresses displayed on the **Basic Information** tab page.
